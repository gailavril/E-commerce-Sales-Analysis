Conclusion:
This analysis shows that the superstore's profitability is a mixed story. While the Technology category and sales in key states like California and New York are major strengths, these gains are significantly undermined by two key issues:

Unprofitable Products: The Furniture category, particularly Tables and Bookcases, consistently loses money.

Harmful Discounts: There is a clear negative relationship between discounts and profit. Higher discounts are directly reducing overall profitability.

Recommendations:
To improve profitability, the company should:

Fix the Furniture Category: Re-evaluate pricing, costs, or consider discontinuing the most unprofitable furniture items.

Control Discounts: Implement a smarter discount strategy, reducing or eliminating discounts on low-margin products.

Focus on Strengths: Double down on promoting the highly profitable Technology category in top-performing markets.
